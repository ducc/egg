# egg - the simple error aggregator
egg ingests errors and aggregates them

# goals
1. simplicity - egg should only ingest errors and aggegate them
1. easy to install - unlike sentry, egg only requires one dependency (clickhouse)
1. easy to extend - egg should have a good api so additional features can be built on top of it
1. scalability - if clickhouse can scale, so can egg

# deploying on kubernetes
here's how you deploy it on kubernetes

# development
run `docker-compose up` to get egg running locally!
